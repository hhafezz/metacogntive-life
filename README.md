# Introduction
This material is trying to shed some light on the importance of metacognition for the life of software engineers, and how metacognitive techniques can help make engineers perform at their best. It also tries to come up with some metacognitive techniques for software engineers to use in their different daily activities. 
It worth mentioning that the techniques devised here is not a one-size fits all. This is mainly because we are different, our cognitive abilities are different and our cognitive limitations are different, and one technique will not work for all cases. This is an attempt to raise awareness of some of the techniques that can work in many cases, and maybe point the reader to the direction to find the technique that works best for the reader's cognitive abilities.
