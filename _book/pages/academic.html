<h2 id="cognitive-wrappers">Cognitive wrappers</h2>
<p>Cognitive wrappers can be a very effective tools in preparation for exams, as exams are something that happens very often in the academic learning, so reflection at the end of every exam and adjusting for the next exam can result in exponential improvement in the exam performance. Although cognitive wrappers are usually considered the responsibility of the teacher, but this does not prevent it from also being a tool for the student to improve and enhance the learning performance. Below is a sample cognitive wrapper that can be used in academic exams:</p>
<h3 id="rationale-before-exam">Rationale (Before exam):</h3>
<p>Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why are you taking this course? What are you looking to learn</li>
<li>Why am I doing this cognitive wrapper? How will it help me improve my learning performance?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="reflection-before-exam">Reflection (Before exam):</h3>
<p>Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>How much time did I spend on my preparation for the exam?</li>
<li>How was this time split across the different topics of the subject?</li>
<li>How much time and effort did I spend creating my own examples and analogies from the subject material? </li>
<li>How much time did I spend in any of these activities (Thinking, finding online content, preparing, researching, finding inspiration, analyzing body posture, resting, etc) Was I focused on doing one thing at a time, or was I multitasking?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="comparison-after-exam-and-getting-the-exam-feedback">Comparison (After exam and getting the exam feedback):</h3>
<p>Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What kind of mistakes did I make in the exam? </li>
<li>Why did I make this mistake? Was it something I covered in my study but still did not grasp it well, or was it something I completely skipped? Or was it something was not in the material at all? </li>
<li>Estimate the points you lost because of any of these reasons: Anxiety, Not studying enough, Studying the wrong material, Syntax errors (arithmetic or grammar) </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="adjustment-after-exam">Adjustment (After exam):</h3>
<p>Ask yourself the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did the studying strategy I employed work well? </li>
<li>What are the top 5 things I would do differently the next time I take an exam?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="mental-readiness">Mental readiness</h2>
<p>It is important that you prepare your mind to what is going to happen, for example you should 
know the test format beforehand: Do not just study the material you are examining in, study the test format itself, is it multiple choice, is it open book or closed book, etc. A study on 56 students has shown that students who knew about the test format beforehand has performed better in the exam [4]</p>
