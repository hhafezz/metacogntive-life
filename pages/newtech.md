# Using metacognition for learning new technologies 
How can metacognition assist when a software engineer is learning a new technology (A new framework, a new programming language, etc)? The most widely used technique is the hands on approach, that is to actually use the technology and create a “Hello world” application, and while this approach is effective in evaluating and practicing the procedural knowledge of the technology, It does not directly help with the evaluating the declarative knowledge on the technology. Below are a couple of strategies that can help with this:
## Questioning strategy
After finishing new technology training, try to come up with a set of 10 questions about the technology. Then go back to the source material and see if the material already covers these questions. Then for the questions covered already, try to think about the reasons why you missed the answers in the source material. This will help the mind to rethink the learning strategies in similar situations, and improve on the next iteration.

## Reciprocal teaching
One of the great ways to reflect and reinforce your own learning is to teach it to someone else. For example you have been lucky to be sent to that fancy conference where you learned lots of modern architecture techniques, one of the best ways to make sure you learned the topic is to organize knowledge transfer session to the less lucky people who were not there. And then teach the same material to them, this will be beneficial for multiple reasons:
* You will need to build material that suits the audience, which will make you look at the source material and tweak it.
* You will have to express the material in your own language and your own words, this will help your mind absorb and deeply understand the topic.
* You will receive questions from the audience that probably have not crossed your mind, these questions will make your mind exercise to try to come with the answer on the spot, or maybe it will be too hard that it will send you back to the learner shoes to find the answers. It will be like you are using the questioning strategy but collectively from multiple people in the audience.
