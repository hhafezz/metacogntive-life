# Types of learnings for a software engineer
## Overview of the typical learning types
Many learning activities happen in the daily life of a software engineer, some of these types are listed below
## Academic learning
Software engineering is an engineering practice that is taught in colleges and universities all over the world. Academic learning can have many variations, it can happen in a campus or it can happen completely online. It can also have different levels, it can be for a bachelor's degree or it can be for a postgraduate degree (masters or PHDs).
## Learning new technologies
This happens very frequently throughout the career of a software engineers, as new technologies emerge everyday and become suddenly the hot trend in the market. The demand for it becomes higher, and engineers are chasing the learning of these technologies to stay relevant and in demand.
Although some engineers might have perfected their learning using cognitive skills (without even knowing the scientific terms for it), some others often struggle when learning a new technology. Also it is confusing to select which learning medium will work best for you, should I enroll in a face to face classroom course? Or should I settle with an online self paced course? Or maybe just ignore all kind of learning courses and jump directly into the new technology’s manual to read from the source? That’s often a confusing debate. 
## Project handover
Another activity that happens frequently to software engineers is project handover. This happens when a new person joins a project, or when the project members are rotated to other projects, or maybe when a project is relocated from one place in the organization to another. Project handover is a critical learning activity that involves the learning of a multitude of code, design decisions, architectures and systems. If it does not happen right, it can cause outages the loss of business opportunities.
