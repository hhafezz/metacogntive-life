# Summary
This course is an attempt to shed more light on the topic of metacognition among the software engineering community, to show that it can help with the lifelong journey that typical software engineers have. This course tried to produce easy practical steps that can be used in different learning situations to enforce and use metacognition. But because our cognitive abilities are different and our cognitive limitations are different, it is not going to be a one size fits all guide, but merely an attempt to increase the awareness of the topic, and possibly point the reader to the right direction.
