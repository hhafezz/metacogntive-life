# Using metacognition to onboard a new project (project handover) 
It is quite often for software engineers to join an existing project and try to learn the project and its existing design and code base, how can metacognition assist with this learning activity? 
## Cognitive wrappers
Design a cognitive wrapper to force your mind to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the handover process. For example, the below cognitive wrapper can be used for handovers of software project that involves both code handover and environment configuration handover (deployments and such). This wrapper is based on the research done by Marcha C. Lovett [3]

### Rationale (Before handover): 
* Why is this project important? What is the value for the business?
* Why am I taking this hand over? Just getting an idea on the project or am I going to work on it full time?

### Reflection (Before handover):
* What do I already know about the business of this project?
* What do I already know about the technologies used in this project?
* What do I already know about the software engineering process implemented in this project? 

### Comparison (After handover):
* How did my knowledge of the business of the project differ now? 
* How did my background on the business of the project help me during the handover? 
* Do I know what I need to do to do a change in the projectâ€™s code base and to launch it live? Do I know the whole process (whatever the process is, peer review, testing, UATs, this differs from one project to another)
### Adjustment (After handover):
* Going into the next handover, what would I change in my background before the handover?
* Did the communication medium (face to face, online meetings, etc) help during the learning activity? Would I change it later for something better?
