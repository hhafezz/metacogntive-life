                                <h1 id="metacognitive-strategies-toolkit">Metacognitive strategies toolkit</h1>
<p>There are many metacognitive strategies or tools that has been developed throughout the years, these strategies can be effective in a multitude of situations, some of these strategies are:</p>
<h2 id="cognitive-wrappers">Cognitive wrappers</h2>
<p>The cognitive wrapper is a tool for teaching yourself to monitor your learning. The wrapper is a small activity that wraps the main learning activity (happens before and after it). It can be in the form of a couple of questions that you write for yourself and answer before the learning and after the learning. Thinking about these answers will force the learner to monitor the learning process and hence being able to evaluate it. 
Cognitive wrappers usually have the below 4 activities:</p>
<h3 id="rationale">Rationale</h3>
<p>This is a statement of purpose, in this statement you write down why are you doing the learning activity you are doing now. This helps your mind stay focused on the goal. This is written before the learning activity. </p>
<h3 id="reflection">Reflection</h3>
<p>This an assessment of your state before the learning, how much did you know about the topic? How much did you struggle with the problem that this topic is going to solve for you? Did you do any research before doing this learning? </p>
<h3 id="comparison">Comparison</h3>
<p>This is an assessment of your state after the learning, how much did you learn? Do you now possess the declarative and procedural knowledge of the topic? How did your state before the learning help you during the learning? </p>
<h4 id="adjustment">Adjustment</h4>
<p>Now that you finished the learning and finished the assessment, how would you do this differently the next time? What went right and what went wrong? </p>
<h2 id="think-aloud-protocol">Think-aloud protocol</h2>
<p>This strategy depends on the learner speaking their thoughts out loud throughout the learning experience, it is developed by Ericsson and Simon [6], and then the teacher can use this feedback to evaluate the thought process of the learner and potentially correct any possible flaws. 
This approach has many drawbacks, it obviously can&#x2019;t work in on self paced e-learning environments because of the lake of feedback, and without enough guidance, the learner will not be able to know which thoughts should be spoken out loud, and finally it is mostly not realistic to expect someone to speak everything going through their head while they are reading a course text or watching a course video. </p>
<h2 id="questioning">Questioning</h2>
<p>In this strategy the learner finishes the learning activity, and then tries to develop a set of questions on the topic learned, and then goes back to the material again to make sure that these questions were not answered already. This exercise will encourage the mind to evaluate the learning to come up with questions on the material, and will encourage the learner to find the potential gaps in his/her learning technique. </p>
<h2 id="reciprocal-teaching">Reciprocal teaching</h2>
<p>This strategy reinforces the learning by making the learner teach the topic to someone else. It is widely said that &#x201C;teaching is the best way to learn&#x201D;, and this sentence is backed up by some modern research. A study [8] done in 2009 on a group of school students showed that they improved significantly when they started to take turns with the teachers in teaching the topics. </p>
