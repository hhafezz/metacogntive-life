<p>The Software Industry is changing very frequently, new technologies emerge everyday to replace older technologies and making them obsolete, which also causes software engineers&#x2019; skills to become obsolete. Dr. Ernest T. Smerdon the previous head of National Academy of Engineering thinks that the half-life of software engineers skills --how long it takes for half of an engineer&apos;s skills to become obsolete-- is 2.5 years [1], the lowest in the Engineering industry in general. This shows the necessity for software engineers to become lifelong learners if they want to stay marketable and in demand. </p>
<p>The frequent learning activities by software engineers can really use the help of metacognition and self regulated learning strategies. As we seen metacognitive knowledge is a key attribute that defines an expert.  </p>
<h2 id="defining-expertise">Defining expertise</h2>
<p>If you examine job ads asking for software developers, they are always searching for an expert in technology X or framework Y, and while the technology itself might not be older than a year or two, but the ads are almost always looking for experts, and this is the common expectations for software engineers. It is not just to learn the basics, but to develop deep expertise in emerging technologies, but what is expertise? How can it be defined?  </p>
<p>There has been multiple attempts at defining expertise, the naive definition would be that an expert is someone who has many years of experience in a topic. This definition is rather weak because the years of experience in a topic or a task has no direct relation with the person&#x2019;s proficiency in this topic.</p>
<p>Another definition possibly relates more to software engineers is that a person can be called an expert if he has: 
Declarative knowledge: They know the theory and can explain it in clear terms.
Procedural knowledge: They know the how to do it and they can do it.</p>
<p>Let&#x2019;s give a concrete example on this definition, an engineer can be called an expert of Object-oriented programming (OOP) if he posses the declarative knowledge of it (encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, etc), and he posses the procedural knowledge that allows him to implement in a programming language (can create a class, extend it, etc) </p>
<p>One final definition published recently by Gobet F. [3] is that an expert in a specific domain is &#x201C;somebody who obtains results that are vastly superior to those obtained by the majority of the population.&#x201D;</p>
<h2 id="measuring-effectiveness-of-software-engineers-learning">Measuring effectiveness of software engineer&#x2019;s learning</h2>
<p>So in the route to become expert software engineers, how can the effectiveness of software engineer&#x2019;s learning can be measured? There are multiple models to measure the effectiveness of learning activities, maybe the most adopted one is the Kirkpatrick model. Donald Kirkpatrick came up with this model in his PhD dissertation, and later developed it further to become widely used in learning activities. The model employs 4 activities:</p>
<h3 id="reaction">Reaction</h3>
<p>This measures your initial reaction to the training, how do you feel about it? Do you feel you learned something new or was it not worth the time. For example, where you happy taking this Java 8 course? Or was it boring and did not add much to you? </p>
<h3 id="learning">Learning</h3>
<p>This activity tries to measure how much did you learn from the training, this ideally can be done by giving yourself a quiz on the subject before and after the learning and see how did the learning affect your knowledge. For example, try to take a quiz in Java 8 before you take the class, and then take it again after and see if the grades are different. </p>
<h3 id="behavior">Behavior</h3>
<p>This activity measures how did your behavior change because of the learning, are you more productive, producing more quality work or did not it make a difference? For example, did this Java 8 course make your code better and makes use of all of the new features of Java 8? Or are you still writing the same old way since the Java 1.4 days? </p>
<h3 id="results">Results</h3>
<p>At this activity the final outcome of the training is analyzed, how did this training impact business targets? Did this Java 8 course help you deliver the project to the business in less time? Or in the same time but with higher quality and reliability? This activity is usually the hardest to measure, as it needs clear KPIs that are frequently absent. </p>
